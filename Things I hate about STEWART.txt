Run 1:
	I picked the run on page 190 because it looked really wonky and fun to animate. Looked fun to exaggerate. I picked it because I wanted to animate one cartoon/film looking run.

Run 2:
	I picked the run on page 184 because it looked a lot like how Snake runs in Metal Gear Solid V. I picked this because I wanted to animate a run that would be for video games.   

Pros:
- He is really stretchy.
- There aren't too many controls, it's not overcomplicated.

Cons:
- His toes don't bend!!!!!!
- You can't move his arm controls with the move tool.
